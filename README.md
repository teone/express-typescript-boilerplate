# express typescript boilerplate

Just a starting poin.

Before start working you need to:

`npm install -g typescript typings nodemon`

## Development

Execute `npm run dev`, will watch files, recompile and reload the node server.

## Production

`npm start` will compile files and start the node server (for real production consider using something else, as `pm2`)

## Test

`npm test` will execute `mocha` tests. They are written in plain ES6 Javascript
